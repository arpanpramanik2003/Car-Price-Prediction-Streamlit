# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning and Streamlit

This project uses a **Random Forest** model to predict car prices based on various features. The predictions are deployed in an interactive **Streamlit** web app, making it simple for users to input details and view estimated prices.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project employs `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for efficient feature encoding and scaling.
- **Random Forest Model**: A Random Forest model is trained to ensure accurate and reliable price predictions.
- **Streamlit App**: An easy-to-use web interface for real-time predictions based on user-provided inputs.
- **Pickle for Model Storage**: The model and preprocessing pipeline are saved using `pickle` for quick access and deployment.
